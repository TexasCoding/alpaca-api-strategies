# Alpaca API Strategies
This project is now just a launch point for testing and running 2 of my other projects. I decided to make seperate packages for Alpaca Markets API. The main project, [PyAlpacaApi](https://github.com/TexasCoding/py-alpaca-api) is only focused on Alpaca API functionality. It aims to make trading through Alpaca's API much easier. It is under development, but functioning well as is. Though lacking some features. Updating daily/weekly.

The [Daily Losers](https://github.com/TexasCoding/py-alpaca-daily-losers) project is a strategy using [PyAlpacaApi](https://github.com/TexasCoding/py-alpaca-api) to trade automatically with Alpaca Markets API. This is the idea that started with this project, but has morphed into a seperate package.
